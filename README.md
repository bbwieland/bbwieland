## Hi, I'm Ben! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a statistician & data scientist currently working as a quantitative analyst with the Philadelphia Phillies R&D team. Previously, my areas of focus in public research include Bayesian hierarchical modeling and generative modeling with sports data. I maintain the `cbbplotR` and `fRisbee` R packages; for issues with those packages, please open a GitHub issue in the associated repository or reach out directly to me via email benbowenwieland@gmail.com
